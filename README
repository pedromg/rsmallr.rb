== description

Nuno Mariz http://smallr.net API talks JSON. So what about accessing it with Ruby ?
Well, quite easy thanks to Florian’s JSON implementation for Ruby. So:

$ sudo gem install json_pure

Remind the need of attention on the use of the address / (slash) just after json and before the query, or you’ll get a HTTP 301 Status Code.
